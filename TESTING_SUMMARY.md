# GoCode Landing - Leads Testing Summary

## Overview
Successfully set up and tested the leads form functionality with Appwrite database integration using Playwright.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Database Setup ✅
- **Issue Found**: The Appwrite collection existed but had no attributes defined
- **Solution**: Used Appwrite MCP server to create all required attributes:
  - `email` (email format, required)
  - `message` (string, 2000 chars, required)
  - `status` (enum: new/contacted/qualified/converted/closed, required)
  - `source` (string, 255 chars, required)
  - `contact_date` (datetime, required)

### 2. Playwright Test Suite ✅
Created comprehensive test suite (`tests/leads.spec.ts`) covering:
- **Form Display**: Verifies contact form elements are visible
- **Form Submission**: Tests successful lead creation and database storage
- **Form Validation**: Tests required field validation and email format validation
- **Loading States**: Verifies button is disabled during submission
- **Appwrite Integration**: Checks for database connection errors

### 3. Test Results ✅
- **18 tests total**: All passing ✅
- **3 browsers tested**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari (WebKit)
- **Database verification**: 9 test leads successfully saved to Appwrite

### 4. Integration Verification ✅
The form submission process works correctly:
1. **Frontend**: React form with proper validation
2. **Database**: Appwrite saves lead with all required fields
3. **Webhook**: Make.com webhook receives notification
4. **Email**: Email notification sent (simulated)
5. **UI Feedback**: Success message shown, form cleared

## Current Database State
```
Database: gocode_main_db
Collection: leads
Total Documents: 9
Attributes: email, message, status, source, contact_date
```
